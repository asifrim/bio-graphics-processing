<h1>README for developers</h1>
<p>
This README is mainly meant to explain (a) how the code works (rather than
how to <em>use</em> the library), and (b) how to contribute to the project.
</p>
<h2>ABOUT ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p>
As there can be a host of optional arguments for several of the methods
(e.g. Track#add_feature), it becomes unwieldy to have them all defined
using the standard ruby way. The Track#add_feature method for example would
then have been defined like this:
</p>
<pre>
  def add_feature(feature_object, label = 'anonymous', link = nil, glyph = @glyph, colour = @colour)
    ...
  end
</pre>
<p>
So if the user would like to use all default settings except for the
colour, he&#8216;d have to specify all those defaults:
</p>
<pre>
  my_track.add_feature(my_feature_object, 'anonymous', nil, my_track.glyph, [0,1,1])
</pre>
<p>
To make the library a bit more userfriendly, I&#8216;ve decided to use
keyword arguments for all optional arguments. The above line then becomes:
</p>
<pre>
  my_track.add_feature(my_feature_object, :colour =&gt; [0,1,1])
</pre>
<p>
The construct you&#8216;ll see for this is as follows (for Track#new):
</p>
<pre>
  def initialize(panel, name, opts = {})
    @panel = panel
    @name = name

    opts = {
      :label =&gt; true,
      :glyph =&gt; :generic,
      :colour =&gt; [0,0,1]
    }.merge(opts)

    @show_label = opts[:label]
    @glyph = opts[:glyph]
    @colour = opts[:colour]

    ...
  end
</pre>
<p>
Basically, this means that the &#8216;panel&#8217; and &#8216;name&#8217;
arguments are mandatory and the other ones are optional. Which optional
arguments are excepted should be listed in the description comments just
above the method code. The Hash#merge that&#8216;s used here just assigns
default values for each arguments that is not mentioned.
</p>
<h2>A. FLOW OF THE CODE</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
I&#8216;ve tried to document as much as possible in the code itself, see
for example the comments that accompany the setting of the defaults for <a
href="../classes/Bio/Graphics.html">Bio::Graphics</a> in the panel.rb file.
However, the bigger picture can not be explained that way.
</p>
<h3>The files</h3>
<p>
There&#8216;s one file for each class: panel, track, feature, subfeature,
ruler and image_map. See the tutorial on a breakdown what each of these do.
All of these except the image_map make up a picture. The image_map is used
to describe the HTML map that can be created to make a picture clickable.
</p>
<p>
Classes are:
</p>
<pre>
  Bio::Graphics::Panel
  Bio::Graphics::Ruler
  Bio::Graphics::Track
  Bio::Graphics::Feature
  Bio::Graphics::SubFeature
  several Bio::Graphics::Glyph::&lt;something&gt;
</pre>
<h3>The workflow</h3>
<h4>1. Creating the panel</h4>
<p>
The user has to start with a
</p>
<pre>
  my_panel = Bio::Graphics::Panel.new(length, width, clickable, display_start, display_stop, verticle)
</pre>
<p>
When this happens, among other things, the instance variable @tracks is
created that will later contain the actual Track objects. In addition,
there&#8216;s @number_of_feature_rows. You&#8216;ll later see that each
Track object also has its @number_of_feature_rows. The panel needs this
information to know how far it has to go down before it can start drawing a
track: the first track will be just below the ruler, but the vertical
coordinates of the second one depend on the height of all the ones that
were drawn previously. And <em>that</em> in turn is defined by the number
of times a feature would overlap with another one and therefore had to be
<em>bumped</em> down.
</p>
<p>
@display_start and @display_stop are used for zooming in on a region. Even
though the full @length of the sequence can be really long, setting
@display_start and @display_stop will only consider that region.
</p>
<p>
Then there is @rescale_factor, which plays a crucial role in drawing the
stuff: it tells the script how many basepairs are contained in one pixel.
This variable will be used <em>very</em> extensively in the drawing code.
</p>
<p>
So this covered the Panel#initialize&#8230;
</p>
<h4>2. Adding tracks to the panel</h4>
<p>
Because tracks are inherently part of a panel and cannot exist on their
own, they can only be created by using a Panel method rather than a Track
method.
</p>
<pre>
  my_track_1 = my_panel.add_track(name, label = false, feature_glyph = :generic, feature_colour = [0,0,1])
</pre>
<p>
Feature_glyph and feature_colour are the default values to use for all
features in this track.
</p>
<p>
The feature_glyph can either be one of the approved symbols (:generic,
:spliced, &#8230;; see documentation Bio::Graphics::Panel#add_track) or a
hash. The keys of the hash refer to the types of subfeature; the values are
these symbols again. For how that&#8216;s used, see below (5. Drawing the
thing).
</p>
<p>
This creates a new Track object and adds it to the @tracks array of the
Panel object. Several instance variables are set for the Track object,
including @features (which is an array of Feature objects for that track)
and @number_of_feature_rows. Every time a feature cannot be drawn because
it would overlap with another one, it will be &#8216;bumped&#8217; down
until it can be drawn. This effectively results in <em>rows</em> that
contain the features. The @number_of_feature_rows is just this number of
rows (to be able to calculate the height of the track afterwards).
</p>
<pre>
  ------------------------------------------------------
    *******    ****  *********         *****    *****
         *****                       ********
                                    **
</pre>
<p>
The Panel#add_track method returns the Track object itself, because the
latter has to be accessible to be able to assign features to it.
</p>
<h4>3. Adding features to a track</h4>
<p>
Same thing as adding a track to a panel: the feature can only be added by
the user by using the Track#add_feature method. Arguments are a <a
href="../classes/Bio/Feature.html">Bio::Feature</a> object (which itself
has a type and location), a label, and the glyph and colour. The glyph can
either be one of the approved symbols, or a hash (see 2. Adding tracks to
the panel).
</p>
<p>
The location of a <a href="../classes/Bio/Feature.html">Bio::Feature</a>
object can be something like &#8216;complement(join(10..20,50..70))&#8217;.
To be able to parse this, I use the Bio::Locations object from bioruby (see
<a href="http://www.bioruby.org">www.bioruby.org</a>). A Bio::Locations
(plural) object contains one or more Bio::Location (singular) objects,
which are the subfeatures: 10..20 and 50..70. It&#8216;s these
Bio::Location objects we use to calculate the ultimate start and stop of
the feature.
</p>
<p>
The Track#add_feature method returns the Track object itself.
</p>
<p>
Now let&#8216;s look at the other end: the Feature object that gets
created. In the Feature#initialize method, you&#8216;ll notice, apart from
the obvious variables, the following instances variables: @subfeatures,
@left_pixel_of_subfeatures and @right_pixel_of_subfeatures. The
@subfeatures thing is quite important. In some cases (e.g. mRNAs that
consist of 5&#8216;UTR, CDS and 3&#8216;UTR), we will want to make a
distinction between the UTRs and the CDS for drawing (see TUTORIAL). To
make this possible, we will have Feature#new always create an Array of
SubFeature objects. Often this array will only contain one object. Drawing
of the glyphs is done on a subfeature-by-subfeature basis. The
@left_pixel_of_subfeatures and @right_pixel_of_subfeatures just represent
the outermost pixels for this feature.
</p>
<h4>4. Creating subfeatures (done automatically by Feature#new)</h4>
<p>
For each subfeature#new several instance variables are created:
@pixel_range_collection, @chopped_at_start, @chopped_at_stop,
@hidden_subfeatures_at_start and @hidden_subfeatures_at_stop. Let&#8216;s
take these one by one:
</p>
<h5>@pixel_range_collection</h5>
<p>
Now <em>this</em> is the crucial bit: it will hold the information on what
pixels (on the horizontal axis) should be covered. This means that any part
of the feature that does not fall within the view is <em>not</em> in this
collection. Basically, for every subfeature (e.g. exon for a gene), the
location of that subfeature is compared to the region of the view. If a
subfeature is not in the view at all, its positions are discarded (but
other stuff does happen, see below); if a subfeature is at the left of the
picture but actually extends outwith the view, the start pixel will become
1. You get the picture. Also see the mini diagrams in the code itself.
</p>
<p>
These start and stop positions are used to create
Bio::Graphics::Panel::Track::Feature::SubFeature::PixelRange objects.
Unspliced objects will have an array @pixel_range_collection with just one
element.
</p>
<h5>@chopped_at_start and @chopped_at_stop</h5>
<p>
Suppose you&#8216;ve got a directed feature (so one with an arrow), and the
3&#8217; end falls outside of the view. What would happen, is that the
3&#8217; end that&#8216;s out of view would be chopped of (that&#8216;s
good), but also that the end of the glyph (which is <em>not</em> the end of
the feature) becomes an arrow. We don&#8216;t want that; instead, the arrow
should be removed.
</p>
<p>
That&#8216;s where the @chopped_at_start and @chopped_at_stop come in. If
these are set to true (while building the @pixel_range_collection), the
arrow is not drawn.
</p>
<h5>@hidden_subfeatures_at_start and @hidden_subfeatures_at_stop</h5>
<p>
For spliced features, it might be that one or more of the subfeatures (e.g.
exons) lies outwith the view. We normally draw e.g. genes by drawing the
exons as boxes and connecting them with small lines. The drawing code
itself (see later) takes all exons within view and draws those connections.
However, if an exon is outside of the viewing area, this line is not drawn.
The @hidden_subfeatures_at_start and @hidden_subfeatures_at_stop are just
flags to capture this.
</p>
<h4>5. Drawing the thing</h4>
<p>
The Cairo and Pango libraries (<a
href="http://cairographics.org">cairographics.org</a>, <a
href="http://www.pango.org">www.pango.org</a>) are used for the actual
drawing. The main concepts in the Cairo drawing model are (please also see
<a
href="http://cairographics.org/tutorial">cairographics.org/tutorial</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>source</b>: the <em>paint</em> you&#8216;ll be using

</li>
<li><b>destination</b>: the <em>surface</em> (Cairo::ImageSurface) that you
want to draw onto

</li>
<li><b>mask</b>: controls where you apply the source to the destination. Stuff
like &#8216;line_to&#8217;.

</li>
<li><b>context</b>: tracks one source, one mask and one destination.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
From the cairo tutorial: &quot;Before you can start to draw something with
cairo, you need to create the context. &lt;SNIP&gt; When you create a cairo
context, it must be tied to a specific surface - for example, an image
surface if you want to create a PNG file.&quot; So that&#8216;s what we
have to do: create a Cairo::ImageSurface and connect a Cairo::Context to
it.
</p>
<p>
Now let&#8216;s walk through the drawing code itself&#8230;
</p>
<p>
When a user draws a panel, the first thing that happens, is the creation of
a Cairo::ImageSurface (the <em>destination</em>). To be able to do this, we
need to know the dimensions. But there&#8216;s a slight problem: we
can&#8216;t know the height of the picture until it&#8216;s actually drawn.
The way we&#8216;ll circumvent this, is that we create a really high
picture (called &quot;huge_panel_drawing&quot;) that we&#8216;ll crop
afterwards.
</p>
<h5>Drawing the ruler</h5>
<p>
A ruler consists of a line with tickmarks on it. The major issue with
drawing the ruler, is determining the distance between those ticks. Suppose
we have zoomed into a small region, we&#8216;d still want to see usable
ticks; and if we&#8216;ve zoomed out to a huge region, we don&#8216;t want
to have those ticks all bumping into each other.
</p>
<p>
To calculate the distance between consecutive ticks, we start with a
distance of 1 basepair, and increase it until the minimal distance
criterion is met. We also set the distance between major tickmarks (which
are the ones that will get a number). There&#8216;s a small issue when you
actually start drawing the ticks. Most of the time, we don&#8216;t want the
first tick on the very first basepair of the view. Suppose that would be
position 333 in the sequence. Then the numbers under the major tickmarks
would be: 343, 353, 363, 373 and so on. Instead, we want 350, 360, 370,
380. So we want to find the position of the first tick. If we&#8216;ve
found that one, it&#8216;s simple to add the rest of them.
</p>
<p>
The ruler height @height consists of the height of the ruler itself plus
the height of the numbers.
</p>
<h5>Drawing the tracks</h5>
<p>
Drawing each track starts out with the general header: a line above it and
the title. We also &#8216;translate&#8217; the track down to not let it
overlap with previously drawn tracks. Obviously, the more challenging part
is drawing the features themselves.
</p>
<h5>Drawing the (sub)features.</h5>
<p>
First thing we have to do, is figure out what the <b>vertical</b>
<b>coordinates</b> of the glyph should be (i.e. the row). To keep track of
what parts of the screen are already occupied by features (so that we know
when a new feature has to be bumped down), we make use of a <b>grid</b>.
The grid is basically a hash with the keys being the row number, and the
values arrays of ranges. (These ranges use basepair units rather than
pixels, but that&#8216;s completely arbitrary.) For each feature, we first
check if we can draw it at the top of the track (i.e. row 1) and if we
can&#8216;t move it down a row at a time until there&#8216;s room for it.
</p>
<p>
So for example, suppose we&#8216;ve already drawn two features that have
the following positions: 100..150 and 200..225. The grid would then look
like this:
</p>
<pre>
  grid = { 1 =&gt; [(100..150),(200..225)] }
</pre>
<p>
If we&#8216;d like to draw a new feature from 125..175 (which overlaps the
first of the two ranges above), we see that row_available becomes false,
and the row number is increased. The grid after adding this feature looks
like:
</p>
<pre>
  grid = { 1 =&gt; [(100..150),(200..225)],
           2 =&gt; [(125..175)] }
</pre>
<p>
So now we know what the vertical coordinates of the glyph should be. But
the <a
href="../classes/Bio/Graphics/Feature.html">Bio::Graphics::Feature</a> does
not do the drawing&#8230; The reason for this is that a Feature can have
SubFeatures (e.g. a transcript feature can have UTR and CDS subfeatures).
If that&#8216;s not the case, the Feature is seen as having one SubFeature.
</p>
<p>
Next step is to check if there&#8216;s reasons we would like to
<b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> <b>glyph</b> <b>type</b>
<b>from</b> <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> <b>undirected</b>. If the user asks
for directed glyphs (i.e. ones with an arrow at the end), but the view is
zoomed <em>way</em> out, there&#8216;s no way the arrow will be visible. If
we&#8216;d try to draw that arrow anyway, it would become bigger than the
feature itself. Another reason would be if the feature&#8216;s 3&#8217; end
extends outwith the picture.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we can <b>draw</b>. As there are several types of glyphs, this is
handled by a Glyph object. These are defined in the lib/bio/graphics/glyphs
directory. These files are automatically read when requiring
lib/bio-graphics. The actual drawing bit should be quite self-explanatory
(<em>move_to</em>, <em>line_to</em>, &#8230;).
</p>
<p>
For the spliced features (:spliced and :directed_spliced), we first draw
the components (i.e. the exons) keeping track of the start and stop
positions of the gaps (i.e. introns). We then add the connections in those
gaps. In addition, we draw a line that extends to the side of the picture
if there are exons out of view. This flag was set when the feature was
created (see above: @hidden_subfeatures_at_start and
@hidden_subfeatures_at_stop).
</p>
<p>
When the user wants a clickable map, we also have to record that this
region should be added to the image map.
</p>
<p>
When everything has been drawn, we finally know the number of rows for that
track (i.e. the number_of_times_bumped).
</p>
<h5>Finalizing the panel</h5>
<p>
So now we have a huge panel (see &quot;huge_panel_drawing&quot; above)
which is way to high. This is converted to a panel of the right size by
creating a new panel (i.e. the cairo destination), and then using the huge
panel as a source to be transferred on that new destination.
</p>
<p>
And we just write the PNG to a file. If the user wanted a clickable map,
also create the HTML file.
</p>
<h2>B. CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>
(This text is adapted from the bioruby README.DEV)
</p>
<p>
There are many possible ways to contribute to the <a
href="../classes/Bio/Graphics.html">Bio::Graphics</a> project, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Join the discussion on the BioRuby mailing list

All of these are welcome! However, this document describes the last option,
how to contribute your code to <a
href="../classes/Bio/Graphics.html">Bio::Graphics</a>.
</p>
<h2>Coding style</h2>
<p>
You will need to follow the typical coding styles of the BioRuby modules:
</p>
<h3>Use the following naming conventions</h3>
<ul>
<li>CamelCase for module and class names

</li>
<li>&#8216;_&#8217;-separated_lowercase for method names

</li>
<li>&#8216;_&#8217;-separated_lowercase for variable names

<li>Use 2 spaces for indentation.

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t replace spaces to tabs.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>
Don&#8216;t use <tt>=begin</tt> and <tt>=end</tt> blocks for comments. If
you need to add comments, include it in the RDoc documentation.
</p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>
Additional tutorial documentation and working examples are encouraged with
your contribution. You may use the header part of the file for this
purpose.
</p>
<h3>Standard documentation</h3>
<h4>of files</h4>
<p>
Each file should start with a header, which covers the following topics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>copyright

</li>
<li>license

</li>
<li>description of the file (<em>not</em> the classes; see below)

</li>
<li>any references, if appropriate

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The header should be formatted as follows:
</p>

      end
    end
  end
</pre>
<h4>of classes and methods within those files</h4>
<p>
Classes and methods should be documented in a standardized format, as in
the following example (from bioruby&#8216;s lib/bio/graphics/sequence.rb):
</p>
<pre>
  # == Description
  #
  # Bio::Sequence objects represent annotated sequences in bioruby.
  # A Bio::Sequence object is a wrapper around the actual sequence,
  # represented as either a Bio::Sequence::NA or a Bio::Sequence::AA object.
  # For most users, this encapsulation will be completely transparent.
  # Bio::Sequence responds to all methods defined for Bio::Sequence::NA/AA
  # objects using the same arguments and returning the same values (even though
  # these methods are not documented specifically for Bio::Sequence).
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  #   require 'bio'
  #
  #   # Create a nucleic or amino acid sequence
  #   dna = Bio::Sequence.auto('atgcatgcATGCATGCAAAA')
  #   rna = Bio::Sequence.auto('augcaugcaugcaugcaaaa')
  #   aa = Bio::Sequence.auto('ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYU')
  #
  #   # Print in FASTA format
  #   puts dna.output(:fasta)
  #
  #   # Print all codons
  #   dna.window_search(3,3) do |codon|
  #     puts codon
  #   end
  #
  class Sequence

    # Create a new Bio::Sequence object
    #
    #   s = Bio::Sequence.new('atgc')
    #   puts s                                  # =&gt; 'atgc'
    #
    # Note that this method does not intialize the contained sequence
    # as any kind of bioruby object, only as a simple string
    #
    #   puts s.seq.class                        # =&gt; String
    #
    # See Bio::Sequence#na, Bio::Sequence#aa, and Bio::Sequence#auto
    # for methods to transform the basic String of a just created
    # Bio::Sequence object to a proper bioruby object
    # ---
    # *Arguments*:
    # * (required) _str_: String or Bio::Sequence::NA/AA object
    # *Returns*:: Bio::Sequence object
    def initialize(str)
      @seq = str
    end

    # The sequence identifier.  For example, for a sequence
    # of Genbank origin, this is the accession number.
    attr_accessor :entry_id

    # An Array of Bio::Feature objects
    attr_accessor :features
  end # Sequence
</pre>
<p>
Preceding the class definition (<tt>class Sequence</tt>), there is at least
a description and a usage example. Please use the <tt>Description</tt> and
<tt>Usage</tt> headings. If appropriate, refer to other classes that
interact with or are related to the class.
</p>
<p>
The code in the usage example should, if possible, be in a format that a
user can copy-and-paste into a new script to run. It should illustrate the
most important uses of the class. If possible and if it would not clutter
up the example too much, try to provide any input data directly into the
usage example, instead of refering to ARGV or ARGF for input.
</p>
<pre>
  dna = Bio::Sequence.auto('atgcatgcATGCATGCAAAA')
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, describe the input shortly, for example:
</p>
<pre>
  # input should be string consisting of nucleotides
  dna = Bio::Sequence.auto(ARGF.read)
</pre>
<p>
Methods should be preceded by a comment that describes what the method
does, including any relevant usage examples. (In contrast to the
documentation for the class itself, headings are not required.) In
addition, any arguments should be listed, as well as the type of thing that
is returned by the method. The format of this information is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  # ---
  # *Arguments*:
  # * (required) _str_: String or Bio::Sequence::NA
  # * (optional) _nr_: a number that means something
  # *Returns*:: true or false
</pre>
<p>
Attribute accessors can be preceded by a short description.
</p>
<h3>Exception handling</h3>
<p>
Don&#8216;t use
</p>
<pre>
  $stderr.puts &quot;WARNING&quot;
</pre>
<p>
in your code. Instead, try to avoid printing error messages. For fatal
errors, use <tt>raise</tt> with an appropriate message.
</p>
<h3>Testing code should use &#8216;test/unit&#8216;</h3>
<p>
Unit tests should come with your modules by which you can assure what you
meant to do with each method. The test code is useful to make maintenance
easy and ensure stability. The use of
</p>
<pre>
  if __FILE__ == $0
</pre>
<p>
is deprecated.
</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>
Finally, please maintain the code you&#8216;ve contributed. Please let us
know (on the bioruby list) before you commit, so that users can discuss on
the change.
